	abstract = {Defects in axonal transport may partly underpin the differences between the observed pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and that of other non-amyloidogenic tauopathies. Particularly, pathological tau variants may have molecular properties that dysregulate motor proteins responsible for the anterograde-directed transport of tau in a disease-specific fashion. Here we develop the first computational model of tau-modified axonal transport that produces directional biases in the spread of tau pathology. We simulated the spatiotemporal profiles of soluble and insoluble tau species in a multicompartment, two-neuron system using biologically plausible parameters and time scales. Changes in the balance of tau transport feedback parameters can elicit anterograde and retrograde biases in the distributions of soluble and insoluble tau between compartments in the system. Aggregation and fragmentation parameters can also perturb this balance, suggesting a complex interplay between these distinct molecular processes. Critically, we show that the model faithfully recreates the characteristic network spread biases in both AD-like and non-AD-like mouse tauopathy models. Tau transport feedback may therefore help link microscopic differences in tau conformational states and the resulting variety in clinical presentations.},

	abstract = {Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, aided by advances in medical imaging, discoveries in physiology and medicine have added nearly 25 years to the average life expectancy. This resounding success brings with it a need to understand a broad range of age-related health conditions, such as dementia. Today, mathematics, neuroimaging and scientific computing are being combined with fresh insights, from animal models, to study the brain and to better understand the etiology and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of age-related dementia in humans. In this manuscript, we offer a brief primer to the reader interested in engaging with the exciting field of mathematical modeling and scientific computing to advance the study of the brain and, in particular, human AD research.},
